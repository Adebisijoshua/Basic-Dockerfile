This is a project to build a basic Dockerfile to create a Docker image and belows are the requirements and the steps I took in solving the problem.

Requirements
--------------------
    The Dockerfile should be named Dockerfile.

    The Dockerfile should be in the root directory of the project.

    The base image should be alpine:latest.

    The Dockerfile should contain a single instruction to print “Hello, Captain!” to the console before exiting.

a) Step 1---------
I opened my  terminal and I created adirectory (folder) for the project:
     (mkdir hello-docker && cd hello-docker)
------------------------------------------------

b) Step 2------------
